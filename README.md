# spotify-project

This was a codeacademy project.

Have yet to gotten it to work, but hopefully as I learn more about react and APIS and stuff I can get it there. The problem is nothing is searching. Eventually, I'd like to rewrite as much as I can using functional components rather than class components. React hooks are much more enjoyable than this.someFunction = this.someFunction.bind(this)
